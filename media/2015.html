      <dd class="ml3 i">Landini was the leading composer of 14th century Italy. His influence is so lasting that his name has been attached both to a common musical figure (the Landini cadence) and a type of computer network (the LAN, or Local Area Network). Known in his own time as a composer, performer, astrologer and philosopher, he is often credited with originating the idea of electronic music in the following quote (translated from Italian):</dd>

      While specific instruments are not specified in the score, PLOrk is performing this piece with an ensemble of invented electronic instruments that are likely what the composer had in mind when he wrote those words. The wind instrument, called the Birl, was invented by PLOrk director Jeff Snyder, with contributions to its firmware and software code by Mike Mulshine, Jamie Chong, and Dharit Tantiviramanond. The percussion session includes both Roland SPDS electronic drum pads and the Drumbox, an electronic drum invented by Snyder, and played directly with the hands.  The violins are processed electronically, and the keyboardists are using custom synthesis developed by PLOrk, along with GameTrak tether controllers originally designed for a golf video game. </dd>

      <dt class="f4 b">Pictagoras, Jabol et Orpheus</dt>
      <dd class="ml0">Johannes Suzoy</dd><br>

      <dd class="ml3 i">This piece is an example of the Ars Subtilior style, which resulted from the influence of mid-20th century concert music upon the court music of the late Medieval period. In addition to adopting the name of an important 20th-century celebrity upon his return from the future, composer Grimace also brought with him the concept of metric modulation from his chance encounters with Stockhausen and Elliot Carter. This innovation led to the creation of a radical style of music that flourished at the end of the 14th century, where the “rhythmic modes” of the previous generation were nearly abandoned in favor of a fluid and infinitely divisible concept of metric values. The music of this style is primarily preserved in the Codex Chantilly, and the French composer Suzoy is represented by three ballades in that collection. The text (not sung in our instrumental rendition) praises the contributions to music of Pythagoras, Jabol and Orpheus. While Pythagoras and Orpheus receive musical accolades elsewhere, Pythagoras for his “discovery” of the proportions that govern musical scales and Orpheus for his otherworldly lyre virtuosity, this is the only known reference to the inexpensive Polish fruit wine Jabol in the classical music repertoire. </dd> </br>

      <dd class="ml3 i">This piece is performed by Jamie Chong and James Bartusek on the Birl, and Mike Mulshine on the Touchkeys, an instrument invented by composer/designer Andrew McPherson. The Touchkeys, here controlling custom synthesis developed by Mike Mulshine, allow a traditional piano keyboard to understand a greatly expanded expressive vocabulary of finger gestures, including x/y finger position and the amount of surface area the finger covers on the key. We hope to capture with this expressive subtlety some evocative element of the “subtle art” that Suzoy intended. </dd>

    <dd class="ml3 i">Binchois is a transitional figure between the Medieval period and the Renaissance, whose music retains elements of the earlier styles while also incorporating the new melodic and harmonic developments of the Burgundian court that he is associated with. His beautifully expressive melodies were well known in his own time, and he was one of the most frequently referenced and copied composers of his day. Nevertheless, the quotes attributed to him in contemporary source materials are invariably bemoaning the shortcomings of the acoustic instruments that he had at his disposal. A typical example:</dd>

      </dd>

      <dd class="ml3 i">This is another Ars Subtilior piece from the Chantilly Codex, and is famous for its attractive score. In the score, the notes are written on the strings of a harp, and the directions for the canonic treatment are inscribed in a scroll wrapped around the instrument. Written in very small script on the tuning pegs of the harp is a series of unintelligible text characters, which were long considered to be simply decorative. </dd><br>
      <dd class="ml3 i">Recently this text was deciphered by musicologist Brad Gersh, and discovered to be a complex code. When encoded into Unicode and copy/pasted into the computer music language Max/MSP, the characters generate an audio “patch” that produces a synthetic harp sound. Interestingly, this harp sound is very similar in design to the Karplus-Strong plucked string physical model described in the 1980s by Kevin Karplus and Alex Strong, and yet was apparently known to learned scholars even in the late 14th century. Some later waveguide techniques developed in the 1990s are also in evidence in the code, a detail that surprises even those who long argued that Senleches had understood digital physical models. A History Channel documentary is currently being filmed about this perplexing situation, to be released in 2016.</dd><br><br>

      <dd class="ml3 i">In this performance, we are adhering to the literal interpretation, and we have developed a system by which the performers in PLOrk can create vocal synthesis with their hands. Each voice is split into two performers, with one controlling the larynx and lungs, and the other forming the mouth shapes to create vowels and consonants. The software we developed is heavily influenced by PLOrk co-founder Perry Cook’s research into physical models of the voice (SHELIA), as well as the formant synthesis work of Sylvain Le Boux. We consider this to be a step toward Cook’s vision of the “Choir of the Future!” The synthesis and control for this piece were developed by Ante Qu, Keji Xu, and AK Williams. The Katzenjammers, a Princeton University a cappella group, will join us to be the choir “as with traditione”. </dd>

Angela Liu (EE ’15) has been developing the software for the EEG sonification and led the project, while Mitch Nahmias, Carolyn Chen and Mio Akasako developed the hardware.
